CharityFree S/W Group Project

In today’s world, hunger is a really huge issue. There are multiple organizations out there trying to battle it, this is where we come in.
We’re developing a website to raise awareness on hunger issues. This website, will be developed using HTML/CSS, JavaScript and PHP MYSQL.
As for the use of the website, it’ll be an interactive trivia where for every correct answer, raw goods will be donated.
